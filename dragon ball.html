        Granolah Saga
        Goku and Vegeta return to training with Whis and Beerus. Meanwhile, a Cerelian mercenary named Granola learns from his employers, the Heeters, that Frieza is alive, and vows to destroy him and avenge his home planet of Cereal. Granolah uses his planet's Dragon Balls to become the strongest warrior in the universe, at the cost of his lifespan. The Heeters manipulate Goku and Vegeta into fighting Granolah. While Goku and Vegeta grow stronger fighting Granolah, and Vegeta gains a new Ultra Ego transformation, the two are defeated by Granolah. Before he can finish them, Granolah's foster father, the Namekian Monaito, reveals that Bardock, Goku's father, had saved them during Frieza's attack on Cereal forty years prior. During the attack, the Heeters, who were behind Cereal's destruction, killed Granolah's mother Muezli. Bardock saved Monaito and Granolah, defeating the youngest Heeter Gas.
        
        In the present, the Heeters Oil, Maki and Gas arrive to finish off Granolah, Monaito, Goku and Vegeta. Gas has become the strongest warrior in the universe, through a wish made to the Cerealian Dragon. Gas easily defeats Granolah and Goku as Vegeta retrieves a Senzu bean. Vegeta feeds the bean to Granolah, who confronts Gas, and overwhelms him. Elec arrives and removes Gas' pendant that was suppressing his powers. Gas goes berserk, but regains control of himself, with Elec's help. With Granolah and Vegeta incapacitated, Goku uses Instant Transmission to lure Gas away from Cereal. Goku, Granolah, Vegeta and Monaito retreat to Monaito's house to recuperate. Monaito gives Goku Bardock's scouter, which contains an audio recording of him defeating Gas through sheer will and determination.
        
        As Monaito heals Granolah, Goku and Vegeta face off against a returning Gas. Despite their best efforts, they are defeated, though Gas' lifespan is also consumed in the fight, aging him greatly. Granolah eventually returns, and seemingly defeats him. As Monaito heals Goku, Vegeta, and Granolah, Gas, in a more powerful though decrepit state, returns and fatally injures Monaito. Granolah tends to Monaito, while Goku and Vegeta fight Gas, but are defeated. Frieza arrives on Planet Cereal, having been lured by Elec so Gas could kill him. Having spent 10 years training in a Hyperbolic Time Chamber, Frieza easily kills Gas and Elec, and reveals his new transformation, Black Frieza, easily defeating Goku and Vegeta. He hires Oil and Maki for his crew and leaves. Whis arrives and heals Monaito, retrieving Goku and Vegeta. After Whis retrieves Goku and Vegeta they go back to Beerus' world, wondering if Frieza is now the universe's strongest warrior.
        
        Super Hero Saga
        Main article: Dragon Ball Super: Super Hero
        Commander Magenta, CEO of Red Pharmaceuticals and son of the late Commander Red, recruits Dr. Gero's surviving grandson and genius scientist Dr. Hedo to help revive the Red Ribbon Army, while Goku, Vegeta and Broly train under Whis on Beerus' planet. Piccolo grows annoyed over Gohan's unhealthy focus on his academic work over his training, though Gohan admits that he has been doing some training. While taking care of Pan, Piccolo is ambushed by Red Ribbon android Gamma 2. Falsely believing that he has killed Piccolo, Gamma 2 returns to Red Ribbon Army's base, not knowing he has been tailed by Piccolo. While at the base, Piccolo discovers that Gamma 1 and 2 were created by Hedo to defeat Capsule Corporation and the Z fighters. Hedo also reluctantly uses Dr. Gero's schematics to create an improved version of Cell, known as Cell Max. Failing to make contact with Goku and Vegeta, Piccolo, disguised as a Red Ribbon Army soldier, volunteers to help "kidnap" Pan to lure Gohan to the base.
        
        Furious upon learning of his daughter's abduction, Gohan attacks the base, and teams up with Piccolo to take on both Gamma 1 and Gamma 2, while trying to convince the androids that they are being manipulated. Magenta runs off to activate Cell Max as a last resort, forcing both Gamma androids, Gohan and Piccolo to cooperate to take on the new enemy; and Bulma arrives with Goten, Trunks, Android 18 and Krillin for reinforcements. The ensuing battle results in Gamma 2 sacrificing himself before Gohan, transformed into a new "Beast" form, successfully defeats Cell Max. Gohan is reunited with Pan, while a repentant Hedo and Gamma 1 are given job positions at Capsule Corporation.
        
        On Beerus' planet, Goku and Vegeta learn from Whis the events that occurred on Earth, including Gohan's new power. After Magenta's funeral, his right-hand man Carmine and Soldier 15 attempt to avenge his and the Red Ribbon Army's demise. The two convinced Goten and Trunks (in their Saiyamen personas) to take out a "bad guy" (Gohan). Goten and Trunks realize the mistake upon reaching Gohan's house. Angered to see Red Ribbon Army survivors, Gohan transforms into "Beast"; it's so powerful Goku and Vegeta can sense it from Beerus' planet. This prompts Goku to arrive on Earth to see Gohan. Goku then takes his sons, Trunks, and accidentally Carmine and 15 to Beerus' planet. After Gohan spars with and beats Gotenks, Goku then challenges Gohan. Gohan and Goku then transform into their Beast and Mastered Ultra Instinct forms respectively and then spar with one another. The fight is even until Goku powers up further, which Gohan does as well; Gohan's overwhelming speed allows him to land several blows on Goku. Goku ends the fight to allow Broly to spar with Gohan. While fighting Beast Gohan, Broly transforms into a Super Saiyan, finally controlling it. Broly and Gohan's growing power agitates Vegeta, who impatiently challenges Gohan, prompting Goku, Goten and Trunks to rejoin the fight. The Saiyan free-for-all brawl results in Beerus' planet being damaged, much to the Destroyer God's anger and annoyance. After eating a meal following the brawl, the Saiyans (with Carmine and 15) return home to Earth.
        
        Production
        When Dragon Ball Super was first announced, Akira Toriyama was reported to be credited for the "original story and character design concepts" of the anime, in addition to his regular role as series creator.[9] The official Japanese name of the series uses the ending suffix 超 which can translate as "super" but instead of using the traditional on'yomi Chō (ちょう) or kun'yomi Ko (こ) reading for the kanji, it is meant to be pronounced and read as Sūpā (スーパー), the English word for "super" in katakana. Other media in the series had done the same like Super Dragon Ball Z.
        
        Toriyama explained his involvement with the "Future Trunks arc" by saying that he created the story based on suggestions from the editorial department, "As with last time, I wrote the overall plot outline, and the scriptwriters have been compiling and expanded the story content into individual episodes, making various changes and additions, and generally doing their best to make the story more interesting."[10] In addition to new characters designed by Toriyama, other characters for the "Universe Survival arc" were designed by Toyotarou, and a few by both.[11] After covering the last story arc seen in the anime series in November 2018, the Dragon Ball Super manga continues with original story arcs.[12]
        
        For the "Galactic Patrol Prisoner arc", Toyotarou wanted the enemy Moro to be truly evil, like Piccolo Daimao was in the original Dragon Ball. He utilized elements of goats, a common Western demon motif, for the character and made his clothes shinigami-esque.[13] Because Jaco and the Galactic King have "classic alien"-like designs, Toyotarou wanted Merus to have a retro look as well and so gave him a silver bob cut. But he also gave the character bishōnen elements because he wanted him to be popular.[13] For the Yardratian race, who are mentioned but never appear in Toriyama's original Dragon Ball manga, Toyotarou and his editor Victory Uchida decided to use both the design seen in Dragon Ball Z and a design created by Toriyama.[13]
        
        The "Granolah the Survivor arc" came about when Toyotarou created Granolah after having proposed various ideas for characters and being unsure if he should use existing characters or create new ones.[14] After settling on a new one connected to the Saiyans, he sent Granolah to his editor Victory Uchida. After the two brainstormed story ideas, he was then given the go-ahead to bring it to Toriyama, who came up with the plot proposal and added the group known as The Heeters.[14] It was Toriyama's decision to have the newly revealed backstory on the Namekian race. Toyotarou called it the "sort of huge decision" that he (Toyotarou) can not make.[14] Because Granolah's race went extinct in the story 50 years prior, Toyotarou made his clothing old-fashioned in addition to adding steampunk elements. After Toriyama reminded him that the Cerealians were not a warrior race but did enjoy fighting, Toyotarou imagined them as sharpshooters and gave Granolah his unique goggles. The goggles double as a communicator because he is a "lone warrior" and Toriyama had previously told him that having two characters converse better conveys characters' inner thoughts than having them talk to themselves. This led to the creation of the character Oatmeel.[14] Toyotarou's designs for The Heeters were rejected three or four times before he came up with the final version, while Toriyama designed the Sugarians after Toyotarou's first two designs were rejected.[14] Toriyama also designed the Namekian Monaito, whom he originally named "Slug" before it was changed to differentiate him from the character of the same name in the film Dragon Ball Z: Lord Slug (1991).[15]
        
        Manga production
        Toyotarou, illustrator of the Dragon Ball Super manga, which began serialization before the anime began airing, explained that he receives the major plot points from Toriyama, before drawing the storyboard and filling in the details in between himself. He sends the manga storyboard to Toriyama for review, who edits the initial draft, making dialogue and art changes, before sending it back to Toyotarou, who illustrates the final draft and sends it to Shueisha for publication.[16]
        
        After the death of Akira Toriyama in March 2024, the Dragon Ball Super manga has been put on an indefinite hiatus.[17]
        
        Anime production
        Toei Animation producer Atsushi Kido previously worked on Dragon Ball Z for a brief time during the Freeza arc, while Fuji TV producer Osamu Nozaki said he has been a fan of the series since childhood.[18] The Dragon Ball Super anime was originally directed by Masatoshi Chioka.[9] Morio Hatano, series director of Saint Seiya Omega (episodes #1–51), began sharing the series director credit with Chioka beginning with episode #28, before taking it over completely with #47. From episode #47 to #76, Morio Hatano shared the role of series director with Kōhei Hatano (no relation), another storyboard artist and episode director for the series.
        
        Masako Nozawa reprises her roles as Son Goku, Son Gohan, and Son Goten.[9] Most of the original cast reprise their roles as well.[6][19] However, Jōji Yanami's roles as the North Kaio and the narrator were indefinitely taken over by Naoki Tatsuta as of episode 12, so that Yanami could take medical leave.[20] Kōichi Yamadera and Masakazu Morita also return as Beerus and Whis, respectively.[19]
        
        The first preview of the series aired on June 14, 2015, following episode 164 of Dragon Ball Z Kai.[21] The next day, the main promotional image for</p>
