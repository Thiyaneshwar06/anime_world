        Jujutsu Kaisen (呪術廻戦, rgh. "Sorcery Battle")[b] is a Japanese manga series written and illustrated by Gege Akutami. It has been serialized in Shueisha's shōnen manga magazine Weekly Shōnen Jump since March 2018, with its chapters collected in 26 tankōbon volumes as of April 2024. The story follows high school student Yuji Itadori as he joins a secret organization of Jujutsu Sorcerers to eliminate a powerful Curse named Ryomen Sukuna, of whom Yuji becomes the host. Jujutsu Kaisen is a sequel to Akutami's Tokyo Metropolitan Curse Technical School, serialized in Shueisha's Jump Giga from April to July 2017, later collected in a tankōbon volume, retroactively titled as Jujutsu Kaisen 0, in December 2018.
        
        Jujutsu Kaisen is licensed for English-language release in North America by Viz Media, which has published the manga in print since December 2019. Shueisha publishes the series in English on the Manga Plus online platform. Two novels, written by Ballad Kitaguni, were published in May 2019 and January 2020, respectively. A 24-episode anime television series adaptation produced by MAPPA, aired on MBS from October 2020 to March 2021; a second season aired from July to December 2023. A sequel covering the "Culling Game" arc has been announced. The anime is licensed by Crunchyroll for streaming outside of Asia, which premiered an English dub in November 2020. The anime's original soundtrack was released in April 2021.
        
        By January 2024, the Jujutsu Kaisen manga had over 90 million copies in circulation, including related novels, digital versions, and Jujutsu Kaisen 0, making it one of the best-selling manga series of all time.
        
        Synopsis
        Setting
        In Jujutsu Kaisen, all living beings emanate energy called Cursed Energy (呪力, Juryoku), which arises from negative emotions that naturally flow throughout the body. Ordinary people cannot control this flow in their bodies. As a result, they continually lose Cursed Energy, resulting in the birth of Curses (呪い, Noroi), a race of spiritual beings whose primary desire is to bring harm to humanity. These Curses are shown as gruesome monsters, onryō (vengeful spirit), yūrei (ghosts), and yōkai.
        
        Jujutsu Sorcerers (呪術師, Jujutsushi, lit. "Cursed Technique Masters" or "Shamans") are people who control the flow of Cursed Energy in their bodies, allowing them to use it as they please and also to reduce its release. High-ranking Sorcerers and Curses can refine this energy and use it to perform Cursed Techniques (呪術式, Jujutsushiki), which tend to be unique to the user or their family. An advanced form of Cursed Technique is Domain Expansion (領域展開, Ryōiki Tenkai), which the users build a pocket dimension of variable size. Inside the Domain, all of their attacks are guaranteed to hit and will grow in strength.
        
        Plot
        See also: List of Jujutsu Kaisen characters
        Yuji Itadori is an unnaturally physically strong high school student living in Sendai. On his deathbed in June 2018, his grandfather instills two powerful messages within Yuji: "always help others" and "die surrounded by people". Yuji's friends at the Occult Club attract Curses to their school when they unseal a rotten finger talisman. Yuji swallows the finger to protect Jujutsu Sorcerer Megumi Fushiguro, becoming host to a powerful Curse named Ryomen Sukuna. Due to Sukuna's evil nature, all sorcerers are required to exorcise him (and, by extension, Yuji) immediately. However upon seeing Yuji retaining control over his body, Megumi's teacher Satoru Gojo brings him to the Tokyo Prefectural Jujutsu High School with a proposal to his superiors: postpone Yuji's death sentence and train under Gojo until he consumes all 20 of Sukuna's fingers so the Curse can be eliminated. At the same time, a group of Cursed Spirits plot a multi-layered attack on the world of Jujutsu sorcery, including the Cursed Spirit Mahito and a corrupted sorcerer named Suguru Geto, who was executed by Gojo a year prior.
        
        Gojo partners Yuji and Megumi with fellow first-year Tokyo student Nobara Kugisaki, training them to become sorcerers, but during a mission gone wrong, Sukuna gains full control of Yuji's body, so Yuji allows the both of them to die. Despite this, Sukuna brings Yuji back to life, having grown an interest in Megumi. Aware the Jujutsu high-ups intend to kill Yuji, Gojo keeps his resurrection a secret to continue training him. On a mission with experienced Jujutsu Sorcerer Kento Nanami, Yuji meets fellow student Junpei Yoshino, who falls victim to Mahito's manipulations, leading Yuji to swear vengeance.
        
        Gojo reveals Yuji being alive during the exchange event between the Tokyo and Kyoto Jujutsu schools. The Kyoto school's principal wants Yuji dead immediately so he schemes to get it done, while the Tokyo students help Yuji. During the event, Cursed Spirits attack the schools, but are fought off by Yuji, Gojo, and third-year Kyoto student Aoi Todo, though Mahito steals three "Death Paintings" (half-human half-Curses), and summons them.
        
        After Yuji is able to consume several of Sukuna's fingers and kill two of the Death Paintings with Nobara's help, disfigured second-year Kyoto student Kokichi Muta, who controls the Cursed Corpse Mechamaru, is revealed to be a mole working with Geto and Mahito. Muta betrays them to protect his friends, only to be killed by Mahito. On Halloween, the Cursed Spirits unleash their ultimate plan by releasing several barriers over Shibuya. Gojo exorcises various Cursed Spirits, but is sealed away by Geto in a special artifact, the Prison Realm. The events also reveal that the current Geto is not the original but rather Geto's corpse possessed by an ancient sorcerer named Kenjaku.
        
        Yuji and his allies face Kenjaku's forces in order to rescue Gojo. Yuji faces Choso, the third Death Painting sibling, and is defeated, only to be spared due to Choso receiving a vision revealing they are brothers. The Cursed Spirit Jogo force-feeds Yuji ten fingers, re-awakening Sukuna, who kills Jogo and destroys a massive portion of the city. Mahito kills Nanami and mortally wounds Nobara, but with the help of Todo, Yuji is able to defeat him. Kenjaku absorbs Mahito, and using his Cursed Technique, re-awakens thousands of new sorcerers throughout Japan that Kenjaku had been planting for thousands of years, as well as unleashing a slew of Curses to usher in chaos a world of Cursed Spirits reminiscent of the Heian period, the prime period of Jujutsu Sorcerers.
        
        In the aftermath, the Jujutsu higher-ups sentence Yuji to death, with second-year student Yuta Okkotsu appointed as his executioner, but Yuta helps Yuji fake his death. Yuji and Megumi team up with Yuta and experienced sorcerer Yuki Tsukumo, both being special grade Jujutsu Sorcerers, along with Choso and second-year student Maki Zen'in to meet Master Tengen, an immortal, part-Curse part-human Jujutsu Sorcerer. Tengen reveals Kenjaku's plan to merge the former's consciousness with Japan's human population using "the Culling Games", a battle royale between all the awakened sorcerers to accumulate a massive amount of Cursed Energy allowing him to achieve this goal.
        
        Maki goes to the Zen'in compound to collect Cursed Tools to assist in the fight, but is forced to kill her entire clan when they lay a trap for her. Meanwhile, Yuji, Yuta, Megumi, second-year student Panda, and third-year student Kinji Hakari, seek out a mysterious woman named "Angel" who can free Gojo from the Prison Realm, as well as find a way to rescue Megumi's step-sister, Tsumiki, from participating in the Games.
        
        The group discovers Angel and that the Culling Games serve its purpose in acquiring a surplus of Cursed Energy for Kenjaku's plans; he succeeds in killing Yuki and capturing Tengen. They then learn that Tsumiki has become a host for a reincarnated sorcerer, and Sukuna uses this opportunity to execute his ultimate plan: taking control of Megumi's body. He succeeds, kills Tsumiki, and regroups with Kenjaku. The main group are able to use Angel's power to free Gojo from the Prison Realm. Gojo, now unsealed, agrees with Sukuna and Kenjaku to fight on December 24.
        
        Gojo faces off against Sukuna and Megumi's Ten Shadows, managing to beat them, however, Sukuna survives and slices Gojo in half, killing him. The rest of the sorcerers, including Yuji (who, with Choso's approval, consumed the remaining Death Paintings), soon join in the battle, with Sukuna reviving himself to his true form in the process. Meanwhile, as Kenjaku is tracking down the remaining Culling Game players, he is confronted by Fumihiko Takaba, an unexpectedly powerful sorcerer that proves as an effective distraction, allowing Yuta to catch him off guard and decapitate him. However, Kenjaku manages to escape via summoning an army of curses, and although Yuta kills him, he adds a rule that allows Sukuna to become the Culling Games' master. Yuta goes to assist Yuji, who is struggling against Sukuna. After a struggle, Yuta activates his Domain Expansion: True and Mutual Love. This acts as a distraction as Yuji attempts to remove Sukuna from Megumi. However, Megumi has lost all will to live, so the plan to save him has failed. Maki then stabs Sukuna as she joins the fight. Maki seems to have the upper hand but Sukuna takes her out of the fight. The second year instructor Kusakabe fights Sukuna but loses despite holding his own. Miguel, Yuta's mentor, reunites with him. Sukuna does not recognize him and they prepare to fight. In a flashback, Gojo reveals that if he and Miguel were to fight with no Cursed Techniques but with Cursed Energy reinforcement, Miguel would win in point movement. Later, Yuji and Maki come back to the fight and Sukuna uses Black Flash four times consecutively. In a flashback, it is revealed that Sukuna ate his twin brother a thousand years ago in the womb because he was starving. Kenjaku then managed to get the soul of Sukuna's twin brother and "made" Jin Itadori, Yuji's father, technically making Jin Sukuna's twin brother and Yuji his nephew, establishing a connection between Yuji's potential and Sukuna's. In the present, Yuji does Black Flash seven times consecutively. After, Sukuna unleashes his Domain Expansion at the same level he did at Shibuya, albeit less stable, leading to it only lasting for 99 seconds. After his Domain ends, he begins to use the same flames he used against Jogo.
        
        Production
        In 2017, Gege Akutami published Tokyo Metropolitan Curse Technical School, a four-chapter series that ran in Jump Giga from April 28 to July 28.[4][5] This series would serve later as a prologue to Jujutsu Kaisen and retitled as Jujutsu Kaisen 0.[6] According to Hiroyuki Nakano, the chief editor of Weekly Shōnen Jump, Jujutsu Kaisen received unanimous approval in the serialization committee.[7] It debuted in Weekly Shōnen Jump on March 5, 2018.[8]
        
        Akutami stated that Neon Genesis Evangelion influenced the mythological aspects of the series,[9] being also influenced by horror and found footage films.[10] Akutami is particularly a fan of Yoshihiro Togashi, author of YuYu Hakusho and Hunter × Hunter,[10][11] expressing intentions to have an art style as close as possible to his.[9] The author is also a fan of Tite Kubo, author of Bleach, and discussed in an interview with him the similarities between their works.[12][13] Other manga artists who influenced Akutami include Masashi Kishimoto (Naruto) and Yusuke Murata (Eyeshield 21 and One-Punch Man illustrator).[9] The magic system of Jujutsu Kaisen is largely inspired by Hunter × Hunter, whose fights, in Akutami's words, "rejects emotional arguments", stating however, that like Daisuke Ashihara [ja], World Trigger's author, whose magic system is also similar to Togashi's series, Akutami is trying to find and develop their own style.[10] In particular, Akutami commented that the first chapter was a mix of Bleach and Naruto. Akutami regretted some decisions made for the first chapter, such as the short appearance of Yuji's grandfather.[14]
        
        In October 2020, Akutami stated that the story's ending and main stages are planned, but that the path between the two remains "fairly free."[9] In February 2021, Akutami stated that the series would probably be finished within two years, declaring, however, no confidence in that statement. Akutami knows how the story for Megumi Fushiguro will end, but not for Sukuna.[15] On June 9, 2021, it was announced that the manga would enter on hiatus due to the author's health issues;[16][17] it resumed publication on August 2 of the same year.[18][19] In December 2022, Akutami hinted that the manga would end within a year, stating during the Jump Festa '23 event: "If you accompany me for up to one more year (probably), I will be very happy."[20] In December 2023, at the Jump Festa '24 event, Akutami stated in a handwritten comment that it would be "probably definitely be the last Jump Festa where Jujutsu Kaisen is still in serialization," hinting that the manga is set to end within 2024.[21]

        Critical reception
        Leroy Douresseaux of Comic Book Bin gave the first volume a score of 8.5/10. Douresseaux praised the series for its characters, plots, settings, and internal mythology, and described it as a "combination battle manga and horror comic book".[160] Shawn Hacaga of The Fandom Post, in his review of the first volume, compared the series to early Bleach and praised it for its world, lore, characters and artwork, concluding that it is a "solid first volume".[161] Hannah Collins of CBR found parallels between Yuji and Sukuna and Marvel Comics characters Eddie Brock and Venom. She also noted similarities to Bleach, Blue Exorcist and Tokyo Ghoul. Collins commended the manga and, regarding its then recently announced anime adaptation, concluded that Jujutsu Kaisen is a "darkly enjoyable action series that's sure to be one to watch out for in 2020".[162] Rebecca Silverman of Anime News Network ranked the first volume as a C. Silverman praised the series' use of Japanese folklore and yōkai elements, comparing this and Akutami's art style to Shigeru Mizuki's GeGeGe no Kitarō, but criticized the story for being "very generic". She concluded, "It has the potential to be more as Akutami gets more comfortable with the serialization process and figures out precisely where the story is going, so it may be worth a second book to be certain. But as of this one, it's just okay, making it the kind of series that gets damned with faint praise".[163] Azusa Takahashi of Real Sound praised its storytelling, setting and "surprising" story development, also noting similarities to other works like Bleach, Ushio & Tora or Neon Genesis Evangelion, stating, however, that the series is not only a homage to popular works centered on the battle development, but that it has a "clever composition that sublimates into originality, so you have to be absorbed in it."[164]

        Critical reception
        Micah Peters of The Ringer said that while the series' "focused execution" of shōnen tropes makes it "infinitely watchable", is its "specificity, its personality, its ultra-slick stylishness" what make the show special. He added: "Like with Park's previous work, there is a sumptuous amount of splashy, expensive, mo-cap-enabled animation, delivering on the action promised by the comics".[170] Paul Thomas Chapman of Otaku USA called it a "prime example of average material elevated by excellent execution", adding that it is similar to Bleach and YuYu Hakusho. Chapman commented that Sunghoo Park "puts the "beatdown" in narrative beats", being able to "segue from goofy comedy to chilling horror in an instant", and that he and the crew at MAPPA "make this narrative mutability seem effortless".[171] Ana Diaz of Polygon highlighted the 17th episode, praising the series' treatment of its female characters, different to other shōnen series. Diaz wrote: "Jujutsu Kaisen goes a step further than avoiding gender tropes by presenting a variety of female perspectives. It's not like there's any right way for these young women to deal with the unique pressures they face. The story lets them disagree, and fight for their perspectives and their place". She concluded: "The show's widespread success signals that audiences aren't just ready for change, they're actively craving it. Now, every other creator has the green light to write all kinds of women into their shows".[172]
