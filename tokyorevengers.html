        Main article: List of Tokyo Revengers characters
        Takemichi Hanagaki, a 26-year-old freeter, learns one day that his middle school ex-girlfriend, Hinata Tachibana, as well as her younger brother Naoto, have been killed by the Tokyo Manji Gang. Naoto deduces that every time they hold hands, Takemichi is transported 12 years into the past. In the past, Takemichi's friends are forced into underground matches led by Kiyomasa, a member of the Tokyo Manji Gang. Takemichi discovers that his new friendship with Mikey prevented one of his friends, Akkun, from going to jail in the present. However, after Akkun commits suicide out of fear, Takemichi realizes the Tokyo Manji Gang presents a stronger threat to his friends than he initially thought. After traveling back to the past, Takemichi finds that the Tokyo Manji Gang is declaring war on Moebius, a rival gang, to avenge Pah-chin's friend. Takemichi learns that Mikey's second-in-command, Draken, will eventually be killed and lead to Mikey becoming violent. Takemichi resolves Mikey and Draken's dispute; however, on August 3, 2005, the Tokyo Manji Gang is attacked by a group of Moebius members, who are led by Valhalla member Shūji Hanma. Takemichi learns that Peh-yan colluded with them out of anger for Mikey and Draken letting Pah-chin be arrested, while Kiyomasa had stabbed Draken for humiliating him and causing him to be exiled from the Tokyo Manji Gang. The Tokyo Manji Gang wins the fight, Takemichi defeats Kiyomasa and Draken recovers from his injuries.
        
        Takemichi returns to the present, only to find out that Hinata and his friends still die in the current timeline. With only the clue that Tetta Kisaki transformed the Tokyo Manji Gang into a violent organization, Takemichi returns to the past to find that Kisaki has recently joined the gang, using Pah-chin's absence to become his division's new captain. Mikey promises Takemichi that he will remove Kisaki from the gang if he is able to bring Baji back. With that, Takemichi is officially made a member of the Tokyo Manji Gang under Takashi Mitsuya's division. Takemichi discovers that Mikey holds a grudge against Kazutora for killing his older brother, Shinichiro, two years ago. In addition, Takemichi learns through Chifuyu Matsuno that Baji pretended to defect from the gang to investigate Kisaki. Furthermore, he learns that Kisaki had created Valhalla for Mikey to be its leader, and the Tokyo Manji Gang will eventually be absorbed into Valhalla after a rumble on October 31, 2005 known as "Bloody Halloween"; their loss had been caused by Mikey killing Kazutora out of rage over killing Baji. Though the Tokyo Manji Gang wins, Takemichi is unable to prevent Baji's death. However, Takemichi is able to prevent Mikey from killing Kazutora, and Kazutora decides to turn himself into the police.
        
        After returning to the present, Takemichi once again discovers that the Tokyo Manji Gang has grown into a large-scale crime organization after absorbing the Black Dragons, and his friends still die. When he travels back to the past, he learns that Hakkai Shiba is forced to leave the Tokyo Manji Gang and join the Black Dragons under the orders of his abusive older brother and the Black Dragons' current leader, Taiju, an event that affects the Tokyo Manji Gang's merger with the Black Dragons. After Takemichi reveals to Chifuyu he is traveling through time, Mitsuya makes a deal with Taiju that he will allow Hakkai to join on the condition that Yuzuha, the Shiba brothers' sister, no longer works for the Black Dragons, nor will Taiju be allowed to assault her. After inadvertently preventing Taiju's death, Takemichi realizes that in the original timeline, Yuzuha had killed him after being coerced by Kisaki, which then led to Hakkai taking the blame for her and being forced to follow his orders. Takemichi convinces Hakkai to stand up to Taiju in order to save Yuzuha, and with Mikey and Draken's timely arrival, the Black Dragons are defeated. After their disbandment, Koko and Inupi carry the titles of co-leaders of the Black Dragons' 11th generation and join the Tokyo Manji Gang as Takemichi's subordinates.
        
        By the time Takemichi returns to the present, Tenjiku absorbed the Tokyo Manji Gang after an event known as the "Kanto incident" and left Mikey demoralized to the point of killing all his friends. When Takemichi returns to the past, he finds that Tenjiku, a Yokohama gang led by a group of violent delinquents known as the S-62 generation, has declared war on the Tokyo Manji Gang. While Takemichi and Naoto investigate Tenjiku, both of them learn that Kisaki is a member and that Shinichiro is the founder of the Black Dragons. When they are ambushed by Tenjiku members, they become fatally wounded, and Takemichi travels to the past before they both die. Takemichi learns that Tenjiku's leader, Izana Kurokawa, is a close relative of the Sanos, and he holds a grudge against Mikey out of jealousy, especially when Shinichiro intended for Mikey to become the leader of the Black Dragons. Near the end of the fight, Mikey and Draken arrive after learning from Hinata that Takemichi had been time-traveling to save them. When Takemichi confronts him, Kisaki confesses that his reason for taking over the Tokyo Manji Gang was to boost his social status and woo Hinata.
        
        Takemichi returns to the present to find out that his friends are alive and successful, but Mikey, who has not been in contact with any of his friends for the past 12 years, has established a new gang called Bonten. Takemichi is no longer able to travel to the past through Naoto, but when he saves Mikey from jumping from a building, he suddenly travels 10 years into the past to 2008. Takemichi is now in high school and learns that since the Tokyo Manji Gang has been disbanded, there is currently a power struggle between Rokuhara Tandai, Brahman, and Mikey's new gang, the Kanto Manji Gang. Takemichi prevents Senju's death, but Draken is killed while protecting them. The Kanto Manji Gang wins and absorbs Rokuhara Tandai; meanwhile, Senju disbands Brahman in order to stop Mikey from killing Takemichi. When Takemichi confronts Mikey, Mikey reveals that he died in the original timeline and Shinichiro had traveled back in time to save him by stealing the ability from a homeless man who he murdered. In the present, Takemichi allows Mikey to succumb to his violent nature to fight him.
