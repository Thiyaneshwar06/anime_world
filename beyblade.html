Gingka aims to recover the forbidden Bey, Lightning L-Drago, which has been stolen by the Dark Nebula to use its powers to fulfill their wicked ambitions. Along with his bey, Storm Pegasus, Gingka must face and defeat many foes. Gingka's second-biggest rival is Kyoya Tategami, formerly head of a bad Blader group, called the Face Hunters. Kyoya's goal is to defeat Gingka. Gingka is the Blader who believes that every Blader has a Blader's spirit in them. The Dark Nebula recruits a Blader named Ryuga, who is given L-Drago. He travels around the world, defeating and either recruiting or destroying the Beyblades of other Bladers. Gingka battles Ryuga but is defeated. His friends are also defeated, including Kyoya. There is a tournament that the Dark Nebula has secretly organized called Battle Bladers, and Gingka hopes to battle Ryuga in the final match. Phoenix, a masked, mysterious Blader that appears at the best times, often saving Gingka, his friends, and his rivals. In a fierce battle with Doji, the head of the Dark Nebula, Phoenix saves Hyoma and Kenta. After Gingka arrives, the ceiling begins to collapse, and a broken piece breaks Phoenix's mask, revealing that Phoenix is Ryo, Gingka's father. Ryo explains how Storm Pegasus and the Lightning L-Drago came into existence. After this event, it is Kyoya vs Ryuga, in which Kyoya starts off great but once the spirits of L-Drago enter and consume Ryuga's body he cannot hold his ground. Ryuga then explains that it is Gingka's fault that every one of his friends has been absorbed by the vicious L-Drago. It is the final battle and Ryuga seems to be using his full power against Gingka. Realizing that his friends will always be with him, he retaliates and calls for Pegasus. Before he can do that, it seems that L-Drago is trying to absorb Ryuga himself, changing him into a dragon/monster-like form. Gingka's friends are extremely worried and confused until Ryo comes and explains that nobody had been able to control L-Drago more than Ryuga. Furthermore, Ryo explains that the Lightning L-Drago is responsible for Ryuga's misbehavior. After that Gingka realizes that he needs to save Ryuga and free him of the dark power held in Lightning L-Drago. He uses a new special move, Galaxy Nova, and defeats L-Drago. Ryuga walks away disappointed, but not because he lost, but because he could not control Lightning L-Drago. Gingka tries to pick up Pegasus but Pegasus disappears because it went past its limits numerous times. Ryo reassures Gingka that Pegasus will come back, the crew then celebrates with Hikaru, Tsubasa, and Kyoya, who have just been released from the hospital.
